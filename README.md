The hydrolysis of triglycerides (TAG) into free fatty acids (FFA) is a crucial step in biodiesel production. In this process, the TAGs present in vegetable oils or animal fats are broken down into their basic components, fatty acids, through reaction with water in the presence of an acidic or basic catalyst. These free fatty acids are then esterified with alcohol, usually methanol or ethanol, to produce fatty acid esters, which are the main components of biodiesel. This step is essential for the efficient production of biodiesel, as it converts low-quality TAG into suitable raw materials for the subsequent esterification process.

The implementation of neural networks in the prediction of process variables involves the construction of complex mathematical models that imitate the functioning of the human brain. These models are trained with historical process data and then used to predict the future behavior of variables based on new inputs. Neural networks are capable of learning complex patterns in data and can deal with non-linear relationships between variables. This makes them powerful tools for prediction in a wide range of industrial applications, including process control, production optimization and predictive maintenance.

Project developed with the purpose of implementing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in the prediction of economic, environmental and productivity indicators in a hydrolysis process aimed at the production of biodiesel.

Economic indicators:

  - COP: Operational Cost;
  - CTC: Total Capital Cost;
  - TAC: Annualized Total Cost;
  - PBP: Payback Period.
